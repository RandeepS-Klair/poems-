    <b><h2 style="color: rgb(44, 7, 7)"><u>Introduction</u></b>
    <p><h3 style="color: white"><pre>No study of English Literature is complete without a reading of William Wordsworth, who is perhaps the greatest of the romantic
poets. It was he who rallied for the use of everyday language, commom people and things in poetry. Wordsworth was a great lover
of nature and this poem was inspired by a real life experience.</pre> </p>

    <pre>
        <span>I wandered lonely as a cloud
            That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
            When all at once I saw a crowd,
            A host, of golden daffodils;
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
            
            Continuous as the stars that shine
            And twinkle on the milky way,
            They stretched in never-ending line
            Along the margin of a bay:
            Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
            Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
            
            The waves beside them danced; but they
            Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
            A poet could not but be gay,
            In such a jocund company:
            I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
            What wealth the show to me had brought:
            
            For oft, when on my couch I lie
            In vacant or in pensive mood,
            They flash upon that inward eye
            Which is the bliss of solitude;
            And then my heart with pleasure fills,
            And dances with the daffodils.

        <h1 style="text-align:center; color: rgb(43, 4, 4)"><u> NINE GOLD MEDALS by David Roth.</u> </h1>
    <b><h2 style="color: rgb(45, 7, 7)"><u>Introduction</u></b>
    <p><h3 style="color: white"><pre>Nine Gold Medals is a poignant record of an incident that takes place at the special olympucs, when differently abled contestants set 
off for a race. soon after the race begins one of the contestants has a shrp fall and lies on the tracks crying out in pain and losing all 
hope of ever winning the medal for which he had trained so hard. The eight other contestants in an outstanding show of empathy and compassion,
stop running, return to help him to his feet and together all nine of them link arms and walk to the finishing line. </pre> </p>
    <b><h1 style="color:rgb(43, 4, 4)">NINE GOLD MEDALS</h1></b></h1>
<main><pre><span> 
    The athletes had come from all over the country
    To run for the gold, for the silver and bronze
    Many weeks and months of training
    All coming down to these games.
    
    The spectators gathered around the old field
    To cheer on all the young women and men
    The final event of the day was approaching
    Excitement grew high to begin.
    
    The blocks were all lined up for those who would use them
    The hundred-yard dash and the race to be run
    These were nine resolved athletes in back of the starting line
    Poised for the sound of the gun.
    
    The signal was given, the pistol exploded
    And so did the runners all charging ahead
    But the smallest among them, he stumbled and staggered
    And fell to the asphalt instead.
    
    He gave out a cry in frustration and anguish
    His dreams and his efforts all dashed in the dirt
    But as sure as I’m standing here telling this story
    The same goes for what next occurred.
    
    The eight other runners pulled up on their heels
    The ones who had trained for so long to compete
    One by one they all turned around and went back to help him
    And brought the young boy to his feet.
    
    Then all the nine runners joined hands and continued
    The hundred-yard dash now reduced to a walk
    And a banner above that said (Special Olympics)
    Could not have been more on the mark.
    
    That’s how the race ended, with nine gold medals
    They came to the finish line holding hands still
    And a standing ovation and nine beaming faces
    Said more than these words ever will.</span></pre></main>
