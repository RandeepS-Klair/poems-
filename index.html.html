    <h1 style="text-align:center;color: rgb(43, 4, 4)">  <u>THE COLD WITHIN James Patrick Kinney.</u></h1>
    <b><h2 style="color: rgb(44, 7, 7)"><u>Introduction</u></b>
    <p><h3 style="color: white"><pre>In the poem, The Cold Within the poet James Patrick Kinney has a strong message for mankind. The message that he is trying to convey is that if we 
selfishly hold on to the world's resources, and the wealth that it has to offer, if we persist in discriminating on grounds of race, religion and 
caste then we are lost.</pre> </p>
    <b><h1 style="color:rgb(44, 5, 5)"><u>THE COLD WITHIN</u></b></h1>
<main>
    <pre>
        <span>
    Six humans trapped by happenstance
    In bleak and bitter cold.
    Each one possessed a stick of wood
    Or so the story’s told.
    
    Their dying fire in need of logs
    The first man held his back
    For of the faces round the fire
    He noticed one was black.
    
    The next man looking ‘cross the way
    Saw one not of his church
    And couldn’t bring himself to give
    The fire his stick of birch.
    
    The third one sat in tattered clothes.
    He gave his coat a hitch.
    Why should his log be put to use
    To warm the idle rich?
    
    The rich man just sat back and thought
    Of the wealth he had in store
    And how to keep what he had earned
    From the lazy shiftless poor.
    
    The black man’s face bespoke revenge
    As the fire passed from his sight.
    For all he saw in his stick of wood
    Was a chance to spite the white.
    
    The last man of this forlorn group
    Did nought except for gain.
    Giving only to those who gave
    Was how he played the game.
    
    Their logs held tight in death’s still hands
    Was proof of human sin.
    They didn’t die from the cold without
    They died from the cold within.

    <b><h2 style="color: rgb(45, 7, 7)"><u>Introduction</u></b>
    <p><h3 style="color: white"><pre>The poem "THE BANGLE SELLERS" by Sarojini Naidu revovles around
the bangles and the bangle sellers.
It describes the stges in the life of a woman as well as the life of bangle sellers.The speaker of the poem is one of the bangle

    <b><h1 style="color:rgb(43, 4, 4)"><u>THE BANGLE SELLERS</u></b></h1>
<main><pre><span> 
        Bangle sellers are we who bear
        Our shining loads to the temple fair...
        Who will buy these delicate, bright
        Rainbow-tinted circles of light?
        Lustrous tokens of radiant lives,
        For happy daughters and happy wives.
        
        Some are meet for a maiden's wrist,
        Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
        Some are flushed like the buds that dream
        On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
        Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
        To the limpid glory of new born leaves
        
        Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
        Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
        Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
        Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
        Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
        Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.
        
        Some are purple and gold flecked grey
        For she who has journeyed through life midway,
        Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
        And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
        And serves her household in fruitful pride,
        And worships the gods at her husband's side.</span></pre></main>
